@*Introduction. This is \CLWEB, a literate programming system for Common
Lisp by Alex Plotnick \<plotnick@@cs.brandeis.edu>. It is modeled
after the \CWEB\ system by Silvio Levy and Donald E.~Knuth, which was in
turn adapted from Knuth's original \WEB\ system. It shares with those
systems not only their underlying philosophy, but also most of their syntax.
Readers unfamiliar with either of them---or with literate programming in
general---should consult the \CWEB\ manual or Knuth's {\it \ldq Literate
Programming\/\rdq} ({\sc csli}:~1992).

This is a preliminary, $\beta$-quality release of the system.
To obtain the latest version, please visit\break
\hbox{\.{http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/\~plotnick/clweb/}}\,.

@ A \CLWEB\ source file consists of a mixture of \TeX, Lisp, and \WEB\
control codes, but which is primary depends on your point of view. The
\CWEB\ manual, for instance, says that ``[w]riting \CWEB\ programs is
something like writing \TeX\ documents, but with an additional `C mode'
that is added to \TeX's horizontal mode, vertical mode, and math mode.''
The same applies, {\it mutatis mutandis}, to the current system, but one
might just as easily think of a web as some code with documentation blocks
and special control codes sprinkled throughout, or as a completely separate
language containing blocks that happen to have the syntax (more or less) of
\TeX\ and Lisp. For the purposes of understanding the implementation, this
last view is perhaps the most useful, since the control codes determine
which syntax to use in reading the material that follows.
@^\WEB@>
@^\CWEB@>

The syntax of the \CLWEB\ control codes themselves is similar to that of
dispatching reader macro characters in Lisp: they all begin with
`\.{@@}$x$', where~$x$ is a single character that selects the control code.
Most of the \CLWEB\ control codes are quite similar to the ones used in
\CWEB; see the \CWEB\ manual for detailed descriptions of the individual
codes.

@ A literate programming system provides two primary operations:
{\it tangling\/} and {\it weaving}. The tangler prepares a literate 
program, or {\it web}, for evaluation by a machine, while the weaver
prepares it for typesetting and subsequent reading by a human. These
operations reflect the two uses of a literate program, and the two
audiences by whom it must be read: the computer on the one hand, and the
human programmers that must understand and maintain it on the other.

Our tangler has two main interface functions: |tangle-file| and |load-web|.
The first is analogous to |compile-file|: given a file containing \CLWEB\
source, it produces an output file that can be subsequently loaded into a
Lisp image with |load|. The function |load-web| is analogous to |load|,
but also accepts \CLWEB\ source as input instead of ordinary Lisp source:
it loads a web into the Lisp environment.

The weaver has a single entry point: |weave| takes a web as input and
generates a file that can be fed to \TeX\ to generate a pretty-printed
version of that web.

@1*System construction. We'll start by setting up a package for the system.
In addition to the top-level tangler and weaver functions mentioned above,
there's also |load-sections-from-temp-file|, which is conceptually part of
the tangler, but is a special-purpose routine designed to be used in
conjunction with an editor such as Emacs to provide incremental
redefinition of sections; the user will generally never need to call it
directly. Then there are a few global variables that control various
operations of the weaver. The remainder of the exported symbols are
condition classes for the various errors and warnings that might be
signaled while processing a web.

@t*Test suite. The test suite for this system uses Richard Waters's
{\sc rt} library, a copy of which is included in the distribution. For more
information on {\sc rt}, see Richard C.~Waters, ``Supporting the Regression
Testing of Lisp Programs,'' {\it SIGPLAN Lisp Pointers\/}~4, no.~2 (1991):
47--53.

We use the sleazy trick of manually importing the external symbols of
the {\sc rt} package instead of the more sensible |(use-package "RT")|
because many compilers issue warnings when the use-list of a package
changes, which would occur if the |defpackage| form above were evaluated
after the tests have been loaded.

@l
(in-package "CLWEB")
@e
(eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
  (require "RT")
  (do-external-symbols (symbol (find-package "RT"))
    (import symbol)))

@ We'll define our global variables and condition classes as we need them,
but we'd like them to appear near the top of the tangled output.

@l
@<Global variables@>
@<Condition classes@>

@1*Utilities.

@ Here's a little utility function that we'll use often. It's particularly
useful for functions that accept a list desginator.

@l
(defun ensure-list (object)
  (if (listp object) object (list object)))

@ And here's one taken from {\sc pcl}: |mapappend| is like |mapcar| except
that the results are appended together.

@l
(defun mapappend (function &rest args)
  (if (some #'null args)
      ()
      (append (apply function (mapcar #'car args))
              (apply #'mapappend function (mapcar #'cdr args)))))

@ Sometimes, when we're accumulating text, we won't want to bother with
empty strings. In such cases we'll use the following macro, which is like
|push| but does nothing if the new object is an empty string or |nil|.

@l
(defmacro maybe-push (obj place &aux (g (gensym)))
  `(let ((,g ,obj))
     (when (if (stringp ,g) (plusp (length ,g)) ,g)
       (push ,g ,place))))

@t@l
(deftest maybe-push
  (let ((list '()))
    (maybe-push 'a list)
    (maybe-push nil list)
    (maybe-push "" list)
    (maybe-push 'b list)
    list)
  (b a))

@ This next macro has been written many times by many authors under
many names, which seems somehow appropriate. Paul Graham calls it
|with-gensyms|, but I prefer the more descriptive |with-unique-names|.
It captures a common idiom used in writing macros: given a list of
symbols, it executes the given body in an environment augmented with
bindings for each of those symbols to a fresh, uninterned symbol.

@l
(eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
  (defmacro with-unique-names (symbols &body body)
    `(let ,(loop for symbol in symbols
                 collect `(,symbol (copy-symbol ',symbol)))
       ,@body)))

@*Sections. The fundamental unit of a web is the {\it section}, which may
be either {\it named\/} or~{\it unnamed}. Named sections are conceptually
very much like parameterless macros, except that they can be defined
piecemeal. The tangler replaces references to a named section with all of
the code defined in all of the sections with that name. (This is where the
name `tangling' comes from: code may be broken up and presented in whatever
order suits the expository purposes of the author, but is then spliced back
together into the order that the programming language expects.) Unnamed
sections, on the other hand, are evaluated or written out to a file for
compilation in the order in which they appear in the source file.

Every section is assigned a number, which the weaver uses for generating
cross-references. The numbers themselves never appear in the source file:
they are generated automatically by the system.

Aside from a name, a section may have a {\it commentary part}, optionally
followed by a {\it code part}. (We don't support the `middle' part of a
section that \WEB\ and \CWEB's sections have, since the kinds of definitions
that can appear there are essentially irrelevant in Lisp.)  The commentary
part consists of \TeX\ material that describes the section; the weaver
copies it (nearly) verbatim into the \TeX\ output file, and the tangler
ignores it. The code part contains Lisp forms and named section references;
the tangler will eventually evaluate or compile those forms, while the
weaver pretty-prints them to the \TeX\ output file.
@^\WEB@>
@^\CWEB@>

Three control codes begin a section: \.{@@\ }, \.{@@*}, and \.{@@t}.
Most sections will begin with \.{@@\ }: these are `regular' sections,
which might be named or unnamed.

@l
(defclass section ()
  ((name :accessor section-name :initarg :name)
   (number :accessor section-number)
   (commentary :accessor section-commentary :initarg :commentary)
   (code :accessor section-code :initarg :code))
  (:default-initargs :name nil :commentary nil :code nil))

@t It's occasionally useful in testing to be able to use numbers as if
they were sections, at least for numbering purposes.

@l
(defmethod section-number ((section integer)) section)

@ Sections introduced with \.{@@*} (`starred' sections) begin a new group
of sections, and get some special formatting during weaving. The control
code \.{@@*} should be immediately followed by a title for this group,
terminated by a period. That title will appear as a run-in heading at the
beginning of the section, as a running head on all subsequent pages until
the next starred section, and in the table of contents.

Starred sections have a numeric parameter associated with them called
`depth'. The depth of a starred section affects how it is formatted in the
woven output: the section name is indented according to its depth in the
table of contents, and sections with small depths (i.e., close to 0) force
a page break.

The tangler makes no distinction at all between sections with stars and
ones with none upon thars.

@l
(defclass starred-section (section)
  ((depth :reader section-depth :initarg :depth))
  (:default-initargs :depth 0))

(defun starred-section-p (object) (typep object 'starred-section))

@ Non-starred sections have no depth, but it shouldn't be an error to ask.

@l
(defmethod section-depth ((section section)) nil)

@ Sections that begin with \.{@@t} are {\it test sections}. They are used to
include test cases alongside the normal code, but are treated specially by
both the tangler and the weaver. The tangler writes them out to a separate
file, and the weaver may elide them entirely.

Test sections are automatically associated with the last non-test section
defined, on the assumption that tests will be defined immediately after the
code they're designed to exercise.

@l
(defclass test-section (section)
  ((test-for :accessor test-for-section :initform nil)))

(defclass starred-test-section (test-section starred-section) ())

(defun test-section-p (object) (typep object 'test-section))

(defmethod initialize-instance :after ((section test-section) &key)
  (when (> (fill-pointer *sections*) 0)
    (setf (test-for-section section) ;
          (elt *sections* (1- (fill-pointer *sections*))))))

@ There can also be \TeX\ text preceding the start of the first section (i.e.,
before the first \.{@@\ } or \.{@@*}), called {\it limbo text}. Limbo text
is generally used to define document-specific formatting macros, set up
fonts, \etc. The weaver passes it through virtually verbatim to the output
file (only replacing occurrences of `\.{@@@@}' with~`\.{@@}'), and the
tangler ignores it completely.

A single instance of the class |limbo-section| contains the limbo text in
its |commentary| slot; it will never have a code part.

@l
(defclass limbo-section (section) ())

@ Whenever we create a non-test section, we store it in the global
|*sections*| vector and set its number to its index therein. This means
that section objects won't be collected by the garbage collector even after
the tangling or weaving has completed, but there's a good reason: keeping
them around allows incremental redefinition of a web, which is important
for interactive development.

We'll also keep the global variable |*current-section*| pointing to the
last section (test or not) created.

@<Global variables@>=
(defvar *sections* (make-array 128 :adjustable t :fill-pointer 0))
(defvar *current-section* nil)

@ @<Initialize global variables@>=
(setf (fill-pointer *sections*) 0)
(setf *current-section* nil)

for |push-section| so that we can override it for test sections.

(defgeneric push-section (section))
(defmethod push-section ((section section))
  (setf (section-number section) (vector-push-extend section *sections*))
  section)

(defmethod initialize-instance :after ((section section) &key)
  (setq *current-section* (push-section section)))

@t Ensure that the |*current-section*| variable is updated after a new
section instance is made.

@l
(deftest current-section
  (let ((*sections* (make-array 1 :fill-pointer 0)))
    (eql (make-instance 'section) *current-section*))
  t)

@ Test sections aren't stored in the |*sections*| vector; we keep them
separate so that they won't interfere with the numbering of the other
sections.

@<Global variables@>=
(defvar *test-sections* (make-array 128 :adjustable t :fill-pointer 0))

@ @<Initialize global variables@>=

  (let ((*sections* *test-sections*))
    (call-next-method)))

need a copy of the limbo text there, too.

@l
(defmethod push-section :after ((section limbo-section))
  (vector-push-extend section *test-sections*))

@t To make testing with sections a little easier, we'll define a macro,
|with-temporary-sections|, that will help ensure that we don't accidentally
clobber any real sections. It executes |body| in an environment where
|*sections*| and |*named-sections*| have been rebound and augmented with
the new sections specified by the |sections| argument. That argument should
be a list of {\it section specifiers}, which are lists beginning with one of
the keywords |:section|, |:starred-section|, or~|:limbo|, followed by keyword
arguments that will be used to initialize new |section| instances; e.g.,
|:name| and~|:code|.

@l
(defmacro with-temporary-sections (sections &body body)

@ We keep named sections in a binary search tree whose keys are section
names and whose values are code forms; the tangler will replace references
to those names with the associated code. We use a tree instead of, say,
a hash table so that we can support abbreviations (see below).

@ The primary interface to the {\sc bst} is the following routine, which
attempts to locate the node with key |item| in the tree rooted at |root|.
If it is not already present and the |:insert-if-not-found| argument
is true, a new node is created with that key and added to the tree. The
arguments |:predicate| and |:test| should be designators for functions
of two arguments, both of which will be node keys; |:predicate| should
return true iff its first argument precedes its second in the total
ordering used for the tree, and |:test| should return true iff the two
keys are to be considered equivalent.

Two values are returned: the node with key |item| (or |nil| if no such node
was found and |:insert-if-not-found| is false), and a boolean representing
whether or not the node was already in the tree.

@ As mentioned above, named sections can be defined piecemeal, with the
code spread out over several sections in the \CLWEB\ source. We might think
of a named section as a sort of `virtual' section, which consists of a
name, the combined code parts of all of the physical sections with that
name, and the number of the first such section.

And that's what we store in the {\sc bst}: nodes that look like sections,
inasmuch as they have specialized |section-name|, |section-code|, and
|section-number| methods, but are not actually instances of the class
|section|. The commentary and code are stored in the |section| instances
that comprise a given named section: references to those sections are
stored in the |sections| slot.

The weaver uses the last two slots, |used-by| and~|cited-by|, to generate
cross-references. They will be populated during reading with lists of all
the sections that reference this named section.

@ Section names in the input file can be abbreviated by giving a prefix of
the full name followed by `$\ldots$': e.g., \.{@@<Frob...@@>} might refer
to the section named `Frob \(foo\) and tweak \(bar\)'.

Here's a little utility routine that makes working with such section names
easier. Given a name, it returns two values: true or false depending on
whether the name is a prefix or not, and the length of the non-`\.{...}'
segment of the name.

@*Reading a web. We distinguish five distinct modes for reading.

in a web. {\it \TeX\ mode\/} is used for reading the commentary that begins
a section. {\it Lisp mode\/} is used for reading the code part of a section.
{\it Inner-Lisp mode\/} is for reading Lisp forms that are embedded within
\TeX\ material. And {\it restricted mode\/} is used for reading material in
section names and a few other places. The modes are named by the symbols

will be signaled, since |read| will skip over the comment and invoke the
reader macro function for `|#\)|'\thinspace.

The solution is to peek at the next character in the input stream and
manually invoke the associated reader macro function (if any), returning a
list of the values returned by that function. If the next character is not
a macro character, we just call |read| or |read-preserving-whitespace|,

@1*Tracking character position. We want the weaver to output properly
indented code, but it's basically impossible to automatically indent
Common Lisp code without a complete static analysis. And so we don't try.
What we do instead is assume that the input is indented correctly, and
try to approximate that on output; we call this process {\it indentation
tracking}.
@^Indentation tracking@>

The way we do this is to record the the column number, or {\it character
position}, of every Lisp form in the input, and use those positions to
reconstruct the original indentation.

We'll define a {\it charpos stream\/} as an object that tracks the
character position of an underlying stream. Note that these aren't
instances of |stream| (and can't be, without relying on an extension to
Common Lisp like Gray streams). But they contain a standard composite
stream we'll call a {\it proxy stream\/} which is hooked up to the underlying
stream whose position they're tracking, and it's these proxy streams that
we'll pass around, so that the standard stream functions will all work.

stream. It relies on the last calculated character position (stored in the

@1*Stream utilities. Sometimes we'll want to look more than one character
ahead in a stream. This macro lets us do so, after a fashion: it executes
|body| in a lexical environment where |var| is bound to a stream whose
input comes from |stream| and |rewind| is bound to a local function that
`rewinds' that stream to its state prior to any reads that were executed in
the body. If |rewind| is invoked more than once, each subsequent invocation
will rewind to the state just after the previous one.

@l
(defmacro with-rewind-stream ((var stream &optional (rewind 'rewind)) &body body)

@ And sometimes, we'll want to call |read| on a stream, and keep a copy of
the characters that |read| actually scans. This macro reads from |stream|,
then executes the |body| forms with |object| bound to the object returned
by |read| and |echoed| bound to a variable containing the characters so
consumed.

@l
(defmacro read-with-echo ((stream object echoed) &body body)

           (declare (ignorable ,object ,echoed))
           ,@body)))))

@ We have to be very careful here about delimiters: for self-delimiting
forms like quoted strings, the final delimiter will be---and should
be---the last character consumed, but if there's some other kind of
delimiter---a closing parenthesis, say---then it should {\it not\/} be
delivered as part of |echoed|. The problem is that such a delimiter may
very well have been read and then unread, and the standard says that when
|unread-char| is called with an echo stream as its |input-stream| argument,
``no attempt is made to undo any echoing of the character that might
already have been done on |input-stream|. However,'' it continues,
``characters placed on |input-stream| by |unread-char| are marked in such
a way as to inhibit later re-echo by |read-char|.'' So we can detect a
previously-unread character by reading and then unreading the next character
in the echo stream and seeing if it actually gets echoed.

@<Should we include the last character of |raw-input|?@>=
(or (eof-p (peek-char nil ,echo nil eof)) ; clearly `yes' for {\sc eof}

@1*Markers. Next, we define a class of objects called {\it markers\/} that
denote abstract objects in source code. Some of these objects, such as
newlines and comments, are ones that would ordinarily be ignored by the
reader. Others, such as \.{()} and~\.{'}, are indistinguishable after
reading from other, semantically equivalent objects (here, |nil| and
|quote|), but we want to preserve the distinction in the output. In fact,
nearly every standard macro character in Common Lisp is `lossy', in the
sense that the text of the original source code can not be reliably
recovered from the object returned by |read|.

But during weaving, we want to more closely approximate the original source
code than would be possible using the standard reader. Markers are our
solution to this problem: we define reader macro functions for all of the
standard macro characters that return markers that let us reconstruct, to
varying degrees of accuracy, what was originally given in the source.

If a marker is {\it bound\/}---i.e., if |marker-boundp| returns non-nil when
called with it as an argument---then the tangler will call |marker-value|
to obtain the associated value. (The weaver will never ask for a marker's
value.) Otherwise, the marker will be silently dropped from its containing
form; this is used, e.g., for newlines and comments. The value need not be
stored in the |value| slot, but often is.

@l
(defclass marker ()
  ((value :reader marker-value :initarg :value)))
(defun markerp (object) (typep object 'marker))

(defgeneric marker-boundp (marker))
(defmethod marker-boundp ((marker marker))
  (slot-boundp marker 'value))

@ We'll define specialized pretty-printing routines for some of the
objects we read for use by the tangler. Since they depend heavily on
the specific representations, they're best defined alongside the readers.

@l
@<Define the function |set-tangle-dispatch|@>

@ Here's a simple pretty-printing routine that suffices for many marker
types: it simply prints the marker's value if it is bound. Markers that
require specialized printing will override this method.

@l

  (lambda (stream marker)
    (when (marker-boundp marker)
      (write (marker-value marker) :stream stream))))

@t@l

  (write-to-string (make-instance 'marker :value :foo)
                   :pprint-dispatch *tangle-pprint-dispatch*
                   :pretty t)
  ":FOO")

@t This |print-object| method is purely for debugging purposes.

@l

  (print-unreadable-object (obj stream :type t :identity t)

      (print-not-readable (condition)
        (marker-value (print-not-readable-object condition)))))
  :foo)

@ A few of the markers behave differently when tangling for the purposes
of evaluation (e.g., within a call to |load-web|) than when writing out a
tangled Lisp source file. We need this distinction only for read-time
evaluated constructs, such as \.{\#.} and~\.{\#+}/\.{\#-}.

@<Global variables@>=
(defvar *evaluating* nil)

@ Our first marker is for newlines, which we preserve for the purposes of
indentation. They are represented in code forms by an unbound marker, so
the tangler will ignore them. We'll interpret two newlines in a row as
ending a paragraph, as in \TeX; the weaver will insert a bit of extra
vertical space when it encounters such markers.

Note that we don't set a macro character for |#\Newline| in inner-Lisp mode,
since indentation is completely ignored there.

  t)

@ The rest of the reader macro functions for standard macro characters are
defined in the order given in section~2.4 of the \ansi\ Common Lisp standard.
We override all of the standard macro characters except |#\)| and~|#\"| (the
former because the standard reader macro function just signals an error,
which is fine, and the latter because we don't need markers for strings).

@ {\it Left-Parenthesis.} We have two different kinds of markers for lists.
The first is one for empty lists, so that we can maintain a distinction
that the standard Lisp reader does not: between the empty list and |nil|.
The second, for non-empty lists, stores not just the elements of the list,
but their character positions as well; this is what allows us to do our
indentation tracking.

preserved during tangling.

@ |#:backquote| is an ordinary macro (not a read-macro) that processes the
expression~|x|, looking for embedded commas. We use an uninterned symbol
for |#:backquote| to avoid problems with macro expansion during indexing;
the indexing code walker breaks symbol identity during macro expansion, but
not for uninterned symbols.

@ We do one simplification here which, although not strictly in accordance
with the formal rules on pages~528--529 of~\cltl\ (section~2.4.6 of \ansi\
Common Lisp), is necessary in the presence of nested backquotes; viz.,~we
will never append |(quote nil)| to the end of a list. This seems to be an
error in the formal rules: in particular, reducing the case of a
|nil|-terminated list to the general case of a dotted list appears to be
overly simplistic.

@ {\it Sharpsign\/} is the all-purpose dumping ground for Common Lisp
reader macros. Because it's a dispatching macro character, we have to
handle each sub-char individually, and unfortunately we need to override
most of them. We'll handle them in the order given in section~2.4.8

@ Sharpsign dot permits read-time evaluation. Ordinarily, of course, the
form evaluated is lost, as only the result of the evaluation is returned.
We want to preserve the form for both weaving and tangling to a file. But
we also want to return the evaluated form as the |marker-value| when we're
tangling for evaluation. So if we're not evaluating, we return a special
`pseudo-marker' with a specialized pretty-printing method. This gives us an
appropriate value in all three situations: during weaving, we have just
another marker; when tangling for evaluation, we get the read-time-evaluated
value; and in a tangled source file, we get a \.{\#.} form.

@ For sharpsign $+/-$, we use the same sort of trick we used for \.{\#.}
above: we have a marker that returns the appropriate value when tangling for
evaluation, but returns a `pseudo-marker' when tangling to a file, so that
we can preserve the original form.

This case is slightly trickier, though, because we can't just call |read|
on the form, since if the the test fails, |*read-suppress*| will be true,
and we won't get anything back. So we use an echo stream to catch the raw
characters that the reader scans, and use that to reconstruct the form.

@1*Web control codes. So much for the standard macro characters. Now we're
ready to move on to \WEB-specific reading. We accumulate \TeX\ mode
material such as commentary, section names, \etc. using the following
function, which reads from |stream| until encountering either \EOF\ or an
element of the |control-chars| argument, which should be a designator for a
list of characters.

    (loop for char = (peek-char nil stream nil eof nil)

@ Several control codes, including \.{@@<}, contain `restricted' \TeX\
text, called {\it control text}, that extends to the next \.{@@>}. When
we first read control text, we ignore inner-Lisp material (that is, Lisp
forms surrounded by \pb). During weaving, we'll re-scan it to pick up such
material. The reason for this two-pass approach is that control text will
frequently be used as keys in the various binary search trees, so it's
convenient to keep it in string form until the last possible moment (i.e.,
right up until we need to print it out).

@ The control code \.{@@<} introduces a section name, which extends to the
closing \.{@@>}. Its meaning is context-dependent.

In \TeX\ mode, a name must be followed by \.{=}, which attaches the name to
the current section and begins the code part.

In Lisp and inner-Lisp modes, a name is taken to refer to the section so
named. During tangling, such references in Lisp mode will be replaced with
the code defined for that section. References in inner-Lisp mode are only
citations, and so are not expanded.

@*Tangling. Tangling involves recursively replacing each reference to a
named section with the code accumulated for that section. The function
|tangle-1| expands one level of such references, returning the
possibly-expanded form and a boolean representing whether or not any
expansions were actually performed.

Note that this is a splicing operation, like `\.{,@@}', not a simple
substitution, like normal Lisp macro expansion:
if \X$n$:foo\X$\mathrel\E$|(x y)|, then
\((tangle-1 \'(a \X$n$:foo\X\ b))\)$\;\to\;$|(a x y b)|,~|t|.

Tangling also replaces bound markers with their associated values, and
removes unbound markers. If the keyword argument |expand-named-sections|
is false, then this is in fact all that |tangle-1| does; we'll use this
capability later in the indexing code.

(defun tangle-1 (form &key (expand-named-sections t))

           (tangle-1 form :expand-named-sections expand-named-sections)))

@ |tangle| repeatedly calls |tangle-1| on |form| until it can no longer be
expanded. Like |tangle-1|, it returns the possibly-expanded form and an
`expanded' flag. This code is adapted from SBCL's |macroexpand|.

@ We're now ready for the high-level tangler interface. We begin with
|load-web|, which uses a helper function, |load-web-from-stream|, so that
it can handle input from an arbitrary stream. The logic is straightforward:
we loop over the tangled forms read from the stream, evaluating each one in
turn.

Note that like |load|, we bind |*readtable*| and |*package*| to their
current values, so that assignments to those variables in the \WEB\ code
will not affect the calling environment.

@ Both |tangle-file| and |weave|, below, take a |tests-file| argument that
has slightly hairy defaulting behavior. If it's supplied and is non-|nil|,
then we use a pathname derived from the one given by merging in a default
type (`\.{LISP}' in the case of tangling, `\.{TEX}' for weaving). If it's
not supplied, then we construct a pathname from the output file by
appending the string \.{"-TESTS"} to its name component. Finally, if the
argument is supplied and is |nil|, then no tests file will be written at
all.

@ The file tangler operates by writing out the tangled code to a Lisp source
file and then invoking the file compiler on that file. The arguments are
essentially the same as those to |compile-file|, except for the |tests-file|
keyword argument, which specifies the file to which the test sections' code
should be written (see~|tests-file-pathname|, above, for the defaulting).

We return the values returned by invoking |compile-file| on the tangled
file, but we actually compile the tests file, if any, {\it after\/} the
tangled file, on the assumption that the tests might require a module
provided by the output file. Note that this might cause the output file
to be unintentionally loaded; the work-around is to disable production
of the tests file by supplying |:tests-file nil|.

@*Weaving. The function |weave| reads a web from |input-file| and produces
an output \TeX\ file named by |output-file|. By default, it also weaves
test sections to the file named by |tests-file| and produces an index and
list of section names which can be included from the output file. The
defaulting behavior for the filename arguments is complex; see below.

If |verbose| is true, |weave| prints a message in the form of a comment to
standard output indicating what file is being woven. If |verbose| is not
supplied, the value of |*weave-verbose*| is used.

If |print| is true, the section number of each section encountered is printed
to standard output, with starred sections prefixed with a `\.{*}'. If |print|
is not supplied, the value of |*weave-print*| is used.

Finally, the |external-format| argument specifies the external file
format to be used when opening both the input file and the output file.
{\it N.B.\/}: standard \TeX\ only handles 8-bit characters, and the
encodings for non-printable-{\sc ascii} characters vary widely.

If successful, |weave| returns the truename of the output file.

the input file may be omitted; it defaults to `\.{CLW}'.

file name by |tests-file-pathname|, which see.

If |index-file| is not supplied or is supplied and non-null, an index of
variables, functions, classes, \etc. will be written to the indicated file.
The default file name is generated from |output-file| by replacing its
|type| component with `\.{IDX}'. In addition, a list of section names will
be written to a file whose name is generated from the index file name by
replacing its type component with `\.{SCN}'.

@ Because we're outputting \TeX, we need to carefully escape characters
that \TeX\ treats as special. Unfortunately, because \TeX's syntax is so
malleable (not unlike Lisp's), it's nontrivial to decide what to escape,
how, and when.

The following routine is the basis for most of the escaping. It writes
|string| to the output stream designated by |stream|, escaping the
characters given in the a-list |*print-escape-list*|. The entries in this
a-list should be of the form `(\<characters>~.~\<replacement>)',
where \<replacement> describes how to escape each of the characters
in \<characters>. Suppose $c$ is a character in |string| that
appears in one of the \<characters> strings. If the corresponding
\<replacement> is a single character, then |print-escaped| will
output it prior to every occurrence of $c$. If \<replacement> is a
string, it will be output {\it instead of\/} every occurrence of $c$ in
the input. Otherwise, $c$ will be output without escaping.

The default value for |*print-escape-list*| defined below is suitable for
escaping most \TeX\ metacharacters; callers should bind it to a new
value if they require specialized escaping.

@1*Indentation tracking. Next, we turn to list printing, and the tricky
topic of indentation. On the assumption that the human writing a web is
smarter than a program doing any sort of automatic indentation, we attempt
to approximate (but not duplicate) on output the indentation given in the
input by utilizing the character position values that the list reader
stores in the list markers. We do this by breaking up lists into
{\it logical blocks\/}---the same sort of (abstract) entities that the
pretty printer uses, but made concrete here. A logical block defines a
left edge for a list of forms, some of which may be nested logical blocks.

@l
(defstruct (logical-block (:constructor make-logical-block (list)))
  list)

@ The analysis of the indentation is performed by a recursive |labels|
routine, to which we will come in a moment. That routine operates on an
list of |(form . charpos)| conses, taken from a list marker. Building this
list does cost us some consing, but vastly simplifies the logic, since we
don't have to worry about keeping multiple indices synchronized.

                                (list-marker-list list-marker)
                                (list-marker-charpos list-marker)))))

@ To build a logical block, we identify groups of sub-forms that share a
common left margin, which we'll call the {\it block indentation}. If that
left margin is to the right of that of the current block, we recursively
build a new subordinate logical block. The block ends when the first form
on the next line falls to the left of the current block, or we run out of
forms.

For example, consider the following simple form:
\smallskip\hskip2\parindent
\vbox{\B\+(first \!&second\cr\+&third)\cr\egroup}
\smallskip\noindent We start off with an initial logical block whose
indentation is the character position of |first|: this is the {\it block
indentation}. Then we look at |second|, and see that the first form on the
following line, |third|, has the same position, and that it exceeds the
current indentation level. And so we recurse, appending to the new logical
block until we encounter a form whose indentation is less than the new
block indentation, or, as in this trivial example, the end of the list.

More concretely, |next-logical-block| returns two values: the logical block
constructed, and the unused portion of the list, which will always either
be |nil| (we consumed the rest of the forms), or begin with a newline.

We keep a pointer to the next newline in |newline|, and |next-indent| is
the indentation of the immediately following form, which will become the
current indentation when we pass |newline|. As we do so, we store the
difference between the current indentation and the block indentation in
the newline marker, so that the printing routine, below, doesn't have to
worry about character positions at all: it can just look at the newline
markers and the logical block structure.

As an optimization, if we build a block that doesn't directly contain any
newlines---a trivial logical block---we simply return a list of sub-forms
instead of a logical block structure. This allows the printer to elide the
alignment tabs, and makes the resulting \TeX\ much simpler.

In the loop, we keep a one-token look-ahead to check for newlines, so that
we can output separating spaces when and only when there isn't a newline
coming up.

The logical-block building machinery above set the indentation on newlines
to the difference in character positions of the first form following
the newline and the block indentation. For differences of 1 or~2 columns,
we use a single quad (\.{\\1}); for any more, we use two (\.{\\2}).

@1*Printing markers. Finally, we come to the printing of markers.
These are all quite straightforward; the only thing to watch out for
is the priorities. Because |pprint-dispatch| doesn't respect sub-type
relationships, we need to set a higher priority for a sub-class than
for its parent if we want a specialized pretty-printing routine.

Many of these routines output \TeX\ macros defined in \.{clwebmac.tex},
which see.

@*Code walking. Our last major task is to produce an index of every
interesting symbol that occurs in a web (we'll define what makes a
symbol `interesting' later). We would like separate entries for each
kind of object that a given symbol names: e.g., local or global function,
lexical or special variable, \etc. And finally, we should note whether
a given occurrence of a symbol is a definition/binding or just a use.

In order to accomplish this, we need to walk the tangled code of the
entire program, since the meaning of a symbol in Common Lisp depends,
in general, on its lexical environment, which can only be determined
by code walking. For reasons that will be explained later, we'll
actually be walking a special sort of munged code that isn't exactly
Common Lisp. And because of this, none of the available code walkers
will quite do what we want. So we'll roll our own.

@ We'll use the environments {\sc api} defined in~\cltl, since even
though it's not part of the Common Lisp standard, it's widely supported,
and does everything we need it to do.
@^environments {\sc api}@>
@^\cltl@>

Allegro Common Lisp has an additional function,
|ensure-portable-walking-environment|, that needs to be called on
any environment object that a portable walker uses; we'll provide
a trivial definition for other Lisps.

@ Allegro doesn't define |parse-macro| or |enclose|, so we'll need
to provide our own definitions. In fact, we'll use our own version
of |enclose| on all implementations (note that it's shadowed in
the package definition at the beginning of the program). Thanks
to Duane Rettig of Franz,~Inc.\ for the idea behind this trivial
implementation (post to comp.lang.lisp of 18~Oct, 2004, message-id

@ The good people at Franz also decided that they needed an extra value
returned from both |variable-information| and |function-information|.
But instead of doing the sensible thing and adding that extra value at
the {\it end\/} of the list of returned values, they {\it changed\/}
the order from the one specified by~\cltl, so that their new value is
the second value returned, and what should be second is now fourth.
Thanks, Franz!

Given a sequence of declarations and possibly a documentation string
followed by other forms (as occurs in the bodies of |defun|, |defmacro|,
\etc.), |parse-body| returns |(values forms decls doc)|, where |decls|
is the declaration specifiers found in each |declare| expression, |doc|
holds a doc string (or |nil| if there is none), and |forms| holds the
other forms. See \ansi\ Common Lisp section~3.4.11 for the rules on
the syntactic interaction of doc strings and declarations.
@^\ansi\ Common Lisp@>

If |doc-string-allowed| is |nil| (the default), then no forms will be
treated as documentation strings.

@ Because of the shorthand notation for type declarations, walking general
declaration expressions is difficult. However, we don't care about type
declarations, since they're not allowed to affect program semantics. We
therefore just throw out everything except |special| and |optimize|
declarations. (The latter are preserved only because CCL's macro-expansion
machinery uses blatantly unsafe code, and depends on local declarations to
lower the safety level.)

{\bf Fixme:} I'm not completely happy with this code. In particular, we
should handle |notinline| declarations, and the lazy way we handle |optimize|
is just no good at all.

We'll start with a little utility routine that walks a variable-like
binding form (e.g., the |cadr| of a |let|/|let*| or |symbol-macrolet|
form). It normalizes atomic binding forms to conses in order to avoid
special cases in the actual walker methods.

the same purpose.

@t We need to make sure that the \CLWEB\ package is in |*index-packages*|

@ Before we proceed, let's establish some terminology. Formally, an
{\it index\/} is an ordered collection of {\it entries}, each of which
is a (\<heading>, \<locator>) pair: the {\it locator\/} indicates where the
object referred to by the {\it heading\/} may be found. A list of entries
with the same heading is called an {\it entry list}, or sometimes just an
{\it entry\/}; the latter is an abuse of terminology, but useful and
usually clear in context.

@1*Headings. In this program, headings are usually represented by instances
of the class |heading|. Headings may in general be multi-leveled, and are
sorted lexicographically. Any object with applicable methods for
|heading-name| and |sub-heading| are treated as valid headings; the former
should always return a string designator, and the latter should return the
next sub-heading or |nil| if there is none.

@l
@<Define |heading-name| generic function@>

(defclass heading ()
  ((name :initarg :name :initform "")

    (heading-name (sub-heading heading))))

@t@l
(deftest heading-name
  (heading-name (make-heading "foo" (make-heading "bar")))
  "foo bar")

@ These heading classes are for headings that should be prefaced with a
\TeX\ macro when printed. Instances of |tt-heading| get printed with `\.{\\.}'
so as to appear in \.{typewriter type}, and |custom-heading| instances are
printed under the control of the \TeX\ macro `\.{\\9}', which the user can
define as desired. Additional subclasses can simply provide new defaults
for the |macro| initarg.

  ((macro :reader macro-heading :initarg :macro)))
(defclass tt-heading (pretty-heading) () (:default-initargs :macro "\\."))

@ We'll allow string designators as headings, too. Notice that we strip
leading whitespace and backslashes from strings acting as heading names;
this helps the common case of a manual entry that begins with a \TeX\
macro sort correctly.

@ We'll be storing index entries in a {\sc bst} ordered by heading, so we'll

complication here is that we want to make it simple to add {\it modifiers\/}

modifiers become part of the name in a predictable way. In particular, the
order is important: we don't want to end up with a heading like `setf local
function' when we mean `local setf function'.

We'll build up a few pieces of machinery that let us define those classes

@ We'll define our type heading classes using the macro |define-type-heading|.
Its syntax is modeled on that of |defclass|: it takes a name, a list of
slot specifiers, and zero or more options. We don't bother accepting a
list of superclass names; all of the classes will be direct subclasses
of |type-heading|.

The |name| argument is what we'll call a {\it short name\/}---a symbol like
|function| or |variable|. These short names will be transformed into longer
names via |type-heading-class-name| to avoid potential conflicts; we don't
actually want to define a class named |function|. To ensure that the longer
class names never need to appear in client code, we'll accept options that
describe methods to be automatically generated that will specialize on the
class being defined.

We'll handle just two of the options accepted by |define-type-heading|
in this section. The first is |:name|, which is used to provide a default
for the |:name| initarg for instances of the defined class. It it's
omitted (the usual case), we'll generate a name from the short name.
The second option we'll handle here is |:modifiers|, which specifies an
ordered list of allowable modifiers.

@ Most of the type headings are associated with a small set of operators
for which they'll serve as sub-headings. For example, when we walk a |defun|
form, we'll use a |function| type heading, and so on. Rather than having
those associations spread all over the indexing walker, we'll put them right
here, with the type heading definitions themselves.

We do this via methods on the generic function |compute-type-heading-class|,
which the indexing methods can call with an operator name to determine which
type heading class to use. The class returned can then be used as the first
argument to |make-type-heading|.

@1*Locators. Now let's turn our attention to the other half of index entries.
In this program, a locator is either a pointer to a section (the usual case)
or a cross-reference to another index entry. We'll represent locators as
instances of a |locator| class, and use a single generic function, |location|,
to dereference them.

Section locators have an additional slot for a definition flag, which
when true indicates that the object referred to by the associated heading
is defined in the section represented by that locator, not just used.
Such locators will be given a bit of typographic emphasis by the weaver
when it prints the containing entry.

@l
(defclass locator () ())

(defclass section-locator (locator)
  ((section :accessor location :initarg :section)
   (def :accessor locator-definition-p :initarg :def :initform nil)))

(defclass xref-locator (locator)
  ((heading :accessor location :initarg :heading)))
(defclass see-locator (xref-locator) ())
(defclass see-also-locator (xref-locator) ())

@ Here's a constructor for the various kinds of locators.

@l
(defun make-locator (&key section def see see-also)
  (assert (if (or see see-also) (and (not section) (not def)) t)
          (section def see see-also)
          "Can't use :SECTION or :DEF with :SEE or :SEE-ALSO.")
  (assert (if def section t) (section def) "Can't use :DEF without :SECTION.")
  (assert (not (and see see-also)) (see see-also) ;
          "Can't use both :SEE and :SEE-ALSO.")
  (cond (section (make-instance 'section-locator :section section :def def))
        (see (make-instance 'see-locator :heading see))
        (see-also (make-instance 'see-locator :heading see-also))))

@1*Index entries. Since we'll eventually want the index sorted by heading,
we'll store the entries in a binary search tree. To simplify processing,
what we'll actually store is {\it entry lists}, which are collections of
entries with identical headings, but we'll overload the term in what seems
to be a fairly traditional manner and call them entries, too.

@l
(defclass index-entry (binary-search-tree)
  ((key :accessor entry-heading)
   (locators :accessor entry-locators :initarg :locators :initform '())))

(defmethod find-or-insert (item (root index-entry) &key
                           (predicate #'entry-heading-lessp)

                    :predicate predicate

protocol functions: |make-index| creates a new index; |add-index-entry|
adds an entry to it, and |find-index-entries| returns the list of locators

passed in as keyword arguments, which we'll pass down to |make-type-heading|.

@1*Referring symbols. We'll perform the indexing by walking over the code
of each section and noting each of the interesting symbols that we find
there according to its semantic role. In theory, this should be a
straightforward task for any Common Lisp code walker. What makes it tricky
is that references to named sections can occur anywhere in a form, which
might break the syntax of macros and special forms unless we tangle the
form first. But once we tangle a form, we lose the provenance of the
sub-forms that came from named sections, and so our index would be wrong.

The trick that we use to overcome this problem is to tangle the forms in
a special way where instead of just splicing the named section code into
place, we make a special kind of copy of each form, and splice that into
place. These copies will have each interesting symbol replaced with an
uninterned symbol whose value cell contains the symbol it replaced and
whose |section| property contains the section in which the original symbol
occurred. We'll these uninterned symbols {\it referring symbols}.
@^referring symbols@>

First, we'll need a routine that does the substitution just described.
The substitution is done blindly and without regard to the syntax or
semantics of Common Lisp, since we can't walk pre-tangled code.

@l
(defun substitute-symbols (form section &aux symbols)
  (labels ((get-symbols (form)
             (cond ((interesting-symbol-p form)
                    (pushnew form symbols))
                   ((atom form) nil)
                   (t (get-symbols (car form))
                      (get-symbols (cdr form))))))
    (get-symbols form)
    (sublis (map 'list
                 (lambda (sym)
                   (let ((refsym (copy-symbol sym)))
                     (setf (symbol-value refsym) sym)
                     (setf (get refsym 'section) section)
                     (cons sym refsym)))
                 symbols)
            form)))

@ This next function goes the other way: given a symbol, it determines
whether it is a referring symbol, and if so, it returns the symbol referred
to and the section it came from. Otherwise, it just returns the given
symbol. This interface makes it convenient to use in a |multiple-value-bind|
form without having to apply a predicate first.
@^referring symbols@>

@l
(defun symbol-provenance (symbol)
  (let ((section (get symbol 'section)))

does the actual indexing.

@l

we don't even have to bother pulling out the index manually.

@l
(defmethod index ((index indexing-walker) name section def &rest args)
  (apply #'index (walker-index) name section def args))

@t Here's a little routine that returns a list of all the entries in an
index. The elements of that list are lists of the form |(heading-names
locations)|, where each location is either a section number or a list
|(:def section-number)|.

@l
(defun all-index-entries (index)
  (let ((entries))
    (map-bst
     (lambda (entry)
       (push (list (heading-name (entry-heading entry))
                   (loop for locator in (entry-locators entry)
                         if (locator-definition-p locator)
                           collect `(:def ,(section-number (location locator)))
                         else

@t To test our indexing walker, we'll use the following macro.

@ We have to override the walker's macro expansion function, since the
forms that we're considering might be or contain referring symbols, which
won't have macro definitions. There are two important cases here:
  (1)~a form that is a referring symbol whose referent is a symbol macro
  in the local or global environment; and
  (2)~a compound form, the operator of which is a referring symbol whose
  referent is a macro in the local environment.
In both cases, we'll index the use of the (symbol) macro, then hand control
off to the next method for the actual expansion.

@ We'll treat |defun|, |defmacro|, and |define-compiler-macro| as special
forms, since otherwise they will get macro-expanded before we get a chance
to walk the function name. In fact, we won't even bother expanding them at
all, since we don't care about the implementation-specific expansions, and
we get everything we need from this simple walk.

Note in particular that we don't record the macro definition when we walk a
|defmacro| form. The rationale here is that if we expand user-defined macros,
forms in the contents of those macros will be indexed for both the macro
definition and the macro use, which would be confusing.

@ Entry headings come in many flavors, and need special treatment in order
to be printed nicely and correctly. We're intentionally conflating headers
with their names here, since the types we accept as names are also valid
headings on their own.

because it's called from a \.{\~/.../} |format| directive; we always ignore
the extra arguments.

@1*Coda: extending the indexer. Here's a self-contained example of how one
might extend the indexer to recognize and record specific kinds of forms.
In this program,we define reader macro functions for most of the standard
macro characters,so it might be nice to have dedicated index entries for
those definitions.

To begin, we'll define a heading class for macro characters, a subclass for
dispatch macro characters, and a constructor function for both.

@l
(defclass macro-char-heading (heading)
  ((name :reader macro-char :initarg :char)))

(defclass dispatch-macro-char-heading (macro-char-heading)
  ((sub-char :reader macro-sub-char :initarg :sub-char)))

(defmethod sub-heading ((heading dispatch-macro-char-heading))
  (macro-sub-char heading))

(defun make-macro-char-heading (char &optional ;
                                (sub-char nil sub-char-supplied-p))
  (if sub-char-supplied-p
      (make-instance 'dispatch-macro-char-heading ;
                     :char char ;
                     :sub-char (and (characterp sub-char) sub-char))
      (make-instance 'macro-char-heading :char char)))

@ When the macro character headings are printed to the index, we'll attach
a little label describing what kind of character they are.

@l
(defmethod print-entry-heading :after (stream (heading macro-char-heading) &key)
  (format stream " ~:[~;dispatch ~]macro character"
          (typep heading 'dispatch-macro-char-heading)))

@ We'd like the macro character index entries to precede all of the other
entries, and we'd like non-dispatching macro chars before dispatching chars.
Most types of index entries wouldn't bother with this; they'd just be mixed
in with the others in the normal lexicographic ordering.

@l
(defmethod entry-heading-lessp ((h1 macro-char-heading) h2)
  (declare (ignore h2))
  t)
(defmethod entry-heading-lessp (h1 (h2 macro-char-heading))
  (declare (ignore h1)))
(defmethod entry-heading-lessp ((h1 macro-char-heading) ;
                                (h2 dispatch-macro-char-heading))
  t)
(defmethod entry-heading-lessp ((h1 dispatch-macro-char-heading) ;
                                (h2 macro-char-heading))
  nil)
(defmethod entry-heading-lessp ((h1 macro-char-heading) (h2 macro-char-heading))
  (char-lessp (macro-char h1) (macro-char h2)))
(defmethod entry-heading-lessp ((h1 dispatch-macro-char-heading) ;
                                (h2 dispatch-macro-char-heading))
  (and (not (char-lessp (macro-char h2) (macro-char h1)))
       (or (and (not (macro-sub-char h1)) (macro-sub-char h2))
           (and (macro-sub-char h1)
                (macro-sub-char h2)
                (char-lessp (macro-sub-char h1) (macro-sub-char h2))))))

(defmethod entry-heading-equalp ((h1 macro-char-heading) h2)
  (declare (ignore h2)))
(defmethod entry-heading-equalp (h1 (h2 macro-char-heading))
  (declare (ignore h1)))
(defmethod entry-heading-equalp ((h1 macro-char-heading) ;
                                 (h2 macro-char-heading))
  (and (char-equal (macro-char h1) (macro-char h2))
       (equalp (sub-heading h1) (sub-heading h2))))

@t We'll use the strict comparison functions we defined above for testing
|entry-heading-lessp| and |entry-heading-equalp|.

@l
(deftest macro-char-heading-lessp
  (let* ((a (make-macro-char-heading #\a))
         (b (make-macro-char-heading #\b))
         (c (make-macro-char-heading #\c))
         (ab (make-macro-char-heading #\a #\b))
         (ac (make-macro-char-heading #\a #\c)))
    (every #'identity
           (list (entry-heading-strictly-lessp a b)
                 (not (entry-heading-strictly-lessp b a))
                 (entry-heading-strictly-lessp a ab)
                 (entry-heading-strictly-lessp b ab)
                 (not (entry-heading-strictly-lessp ab ab))
                 (entry-heading-strictly-lessp ab ac))))
  t)

(deftest macro-char-heading-equalp
  (let* ((a (make-macro-char-heading #\a))
         (b (make-macro-char-heading #\b))
         (ab (make-macro-char-heading #\a #\b)))
    (every #'identity
           (list (entry-heading-symmetric-equalp a a)
                 (entry-heading-symmetric-unequalp a b)
                 (entry-heading-symmetric-unequalp b a)
                 (entry-heading-symmetric-unequalp a ab)
                 (entry-heading-symmetric-equalp ab ab))))
  t)

@ Next, we'll tell the indexer that the symbols |set-macro-character| and
|set-dispatch-macro-character| are `interesting'. (In general, this is
dangerous for symbols in the Common Lisp package, so be careful.)

@l
(defmethod interesting-symbol-p ((object (eql 'set-macro-character))) ;
  t)
(defmethod interesting-symbol-p ((object (eql 'set-dispatch-macro-character))) ;
  t)

@ And finally, we'll add some methods to |index-funcall| specialized on
those function names. Note that by overriding the default method, we
prevent the functions themselves from being indexed, which is what we
want in this case.

@l
(defmethod index-funcall ;
    ((index index) (function-name (eql 'set-macro-character)) form env section)
  (declare (ignore env))
  (when (characterp (second form))
    (add-index-entry index
                     (make-macro-char-heading (second form))
                     section t)))

(defmethod index-funcall ;
    ((index index) (function-name (eql 'set-dispatch-macro-character)) ;
     form env section)
  (declare (ignore env))
  (when (characterp (second form))
    (add-index-entry index
                     (make-macro-char-heading (second form) (third form))
                     section t)))

@t@l
(define-indexing-test macro-character
  ((:section :code ((set-macro-character #\! #'read-bang)))
   (:section :code ((set-dispatch-macro-character #\@ #\! #'read-at-bang))))
  ("!" ((:def 0)))
  ("@ !" ((:def 1))))
